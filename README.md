# Cumulonumba: moist thermodynamic and convective parameters implemented with Numba

*This project is in a proof-of-concept/pre-alpha state, based on the immediate research needs of @jthielen for fast CAPE calculations compatible with Awkward Arrays. Caveat emptor!*

More details to come, but suffice to say for now that this is a collection of MetPy calculations ported to Numba JIT routines with all the Pint- and xarray-specific handling stripped out.
